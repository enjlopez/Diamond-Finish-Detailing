1. open your folder in VS Code.
2. open terminal (ctrl+shift+`).
3. npm init
When you will apply npm init, then there will show some options, you should select 
    i. entry point: server.js
    ii. author name: first_name last_name
4. npm install express
5. npm install dotenv (for environment variable)
6. npm install nodemon (for auto server restart)
7. create .env file at root directory (inside the project folder by clicking +New File) and type PORT=8080 in it using VSC.
10. create .gitignore file at root directory and type node_modules and .env in it in two separate lines.
11. create a new file at root directory: server.js in the same way by clicking on the +File symbol.

    i. Open the server.js file and setup routes
14. create public and views folder and create all html files in views folder.
15. all static files (css, js, images, assets) should be inside public folder.
16. open package.json file and under scripts section, write: "start": "nodemon server.js" in place of "start": test
17. go to terminal and type: npm i (if node_modules folder inside the root directory does not exist), then type npm start
18. go to a browser and open url: "http://localhost:8080/" to test your local server, and you will see your web page on the screen.
19. In this way, after successful server setup, push it to your github:
    i. Go to the soure control menue in VS Code on the left side of the toolbars
    ii. Clik on Initialize Repository
    iii. Type Initial Commit inside the message box.
